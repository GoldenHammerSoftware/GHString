* CHT_CLAIM will do no memory copying but will make the GHString take responsibility for deletion.  
* CHT_COPY will make a copy of the input and be responsible for deletion.

## GHIdentifier

## GHStringTokenizer

GHStringTokenizer is a utility for breaking up a string into tokens using arbitrary delineators.

## GHNumberListParser

GHNumberListParser is a utility for reading in a list of numbers from a string buffer.  For example turning "5 1 19 5" into an array of 4 ints.

## GHHashListParser
